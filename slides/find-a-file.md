##  Find a file

- Ofttimes we work with files such as properties, XML, YAML...
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Demo: Open file app.properties
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> How to find some file fast?
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **Ctrl + Shift + N**
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> This also finds public top-level types, but **not** inner types and non-public top-level types
